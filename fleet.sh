#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fleet.sh — run the hardening playbook (and ad-hoc checks) across your Vultr
# fleet, with the dynamic inventory + vaulted API key wired in so you don't
# repeat the flags every time.
#
# It always uses:  -i inventory/vultr.yml   (discovers running Vultr instances)
# and, for auth, whichever of these you've set up:
#   * inventory/vault.yml present  -> adds  -e @inventory/vault.yml   (vaulted key)
#   * ./.vault_pass present         -> uses it as the vault password (no prompt)
#       else, if vault.yml present  -> adds  --ask-vault-pass         (prompts)
#   * no vault.yml                  -> falls back to the VULTR_API_KEY env var
# (See the README "Managing a running fleet" section for the one-time vault setup.)
#
# Commands (extra args after the command pass straight through to ansible):
#   list                 list discovered hosts + groups
#   ping                 connectivity check (are they reachable as user?)
#   check                DRY RUN of site.yml (--check --diff) — start here
#   apply                apply site.yml to the fleet
#   rotate-keys          apply only the ssh role (--tags ssh)
#   help                 this message
#
# Examples:
#   ./fleet.sh list
#   ./fleet.sh check --limit tag_canary           # dry-run one group
#   ./fleet.sh apply --limit tag_canary           # apply to one group first
#   ./fleet.sh apply                              # ...then the whole fleet
#   # SSH key rotation (after editing ssh_authorized_keys in group_vars):
#   ./fleet.sh rotate-keys --limit tag_canary                         # 1. add new key, test
#   ./fleet.sh rotate-keys -e ssh_authorized_keys_exclusive=true      # 2. drop the old key
#
# Safety: prefer `check` and `--limit` before a fleet-wide `apply`. The disruptive
# roles (ssh/nftables/networkd) can drop connections; roll out in batches.
